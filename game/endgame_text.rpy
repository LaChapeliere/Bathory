Some of our citizens began to gather around this stand, and they seemed to be pleased by what they had on offer. Your fellow reporter couldn't let that slip and had to try the stand for himself.

A weird toad told me to give my name and date of birth. These are non confidential material, and I was surprised that a fortune-teller couldn't have it without me telling them. But I told them anyway.
After that, they asked me if I was willing to know something about my future, even if it was not pleasant. Yeah yeah sure, go ahead and tell me. I had serious doubt about these "powers", I mean, no toad would have this kind of knowledge or arts.

And then... They told me, they very bluntly told me my future. It was quite hurtful because apparently I will get into trouble with my redaction for being too strict about who I will get as an assistant. I was pissed off, I need no assistant of any sort. I can handle my work by myself. They reassured me, told me that it was not about questioning my ability but my well-being. I love my work but yeah sometimes it gets hard. They told me I have great value and I should open my mind into meeting other people, even people that are not like me. It was amazing.

How surprised I was when they came out as a FOX! Yeah, they were a FOX disguised as a toad in order to live with us. Everyone was shocked at first, but they were so reassuring and caring, we had never seen a fox like this. Of course, the palace authority came and took them to our Prince. The Prince challenged them to tell his destiny. And the virtuous circle began again. The Prince was astonished, so much that he allowed this fox to stay with us and be the consultant of the Palace in spirit relationship.

And now, I can proudly say that we are entering a new era: frogs will open their gates to predator spirits again.
